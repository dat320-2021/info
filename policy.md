# Grading and Collaboration Policy

All lab assignments must be completed to satisfaction (passed) in order to sit for the exam.

## Lab Approval Process

Some of the assignments will be automatically approved by QuickFeed when sufficiently many tests pass; these does not require any manual approval.

For assignments that require manual approval, *you must* present your solution to a member of the teaching staff.
This should be done during lab hours, and can be done remotely via Discord.
This lets you present the thought process behind your solution.

When you are ready to show your solution, follow the instructions on Discord to join the approval queue.
Do not send messages directly to the teaching staff on Discord.

It is expected that you can explain your code and show how it works.
The results from QuickFeed will also be taken into consideration when approving a lab.
At least 90% of the QuickFeed tests should pass for the lab to be approved.

Note that, while we prefer that you get approval for each lab on time, it is ok to make arrangements to get approval at a later date, as long as the handin is submitted to GitHub on time.
Please contact the teaching staff to make arrangements.

For labs requiring approval, you may not be approved.
In such cases, you will be granted **one additional attempt** per handin, limited to **max three** additional attempts overall.

### Slip Days

We have frequent lab handins in this course and to add some flexibility to your schedule, we have adopted a scheme with *slip days*.
This means that if you cannot make a handin deadline, you can use up to a total of **seven slip days** throughout the semester without failing the course.
These slip days can be used for things like illness, resit exams, offshore work, military service or other conflicting deadlines.
Weekends and holidays **are included** in your slip day budget.

*Be advised that it is the date on your lab's submission as viewed on GitHub that counts towards the slip days.*

**No special extensions will be given if you have exhausted all your slip days, but we will show some flexibility towards minor overruns.**

## Assignments

### Individual Assignments

*We do not accept joint handins* for individual assignments.
However, we do encourage collaboration on learning the material, e.g., pointing each other in the right direction and giving hints and tips.
You may discuss the assignments with others, but you may not copy answers or code from another student or make your code available to others.

### Group Assignments

For group assignments we expect students to form groups on QuickFeed and work together.
Group members must contribute equally to code, written handins, and oral presentations, e.g., for approval.

Groups cannot be composed of members whose commitment to contribute to the group work is disproportionately different.
Similarly, group members must not be in an exploitable relationship with each other that may lead to a violation of these rules.
For example, group members cannot be in a romantic or marital relationship.

*This rule implies that group members should commit a similar amount of code on GitHub.*

## Plagiarism Warning

Any form of cheating, plagiarism, i.e. copying of another student’s text or source code, will result in a non-passing grade, and may be reported to the university for administrative processing.
Committing acts that violate Student Conduct policies that result in course disruption are cause for suspension or dismissal from UiS.

*Don’t cheat. It’s not worth it!*
